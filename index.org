* About Jared Cox

My name is Jared Cox. I've been a web developer for the past 4 years, mostly working on my website [[https://moldresistantstrains.com/][Mold Resistant Strains]]. There you can find a wide range of productive [[https://moldresistantstrains.com/seed-banks/][marijuana seeds for sale]] online from top breeders. Note that I do not promote nor undertake in illegal activity, I'm a [[https://health.hawaii.gov/medicalcannabis/][State-licensed]] cannabis cultivator.

My seed business is also taxed legally and done by the books. I offer consulting services for business clients in the marijuana seed industry. Contact me [[https://twitter.com/moldresistant][via Twitter]] or [[mailto:jared@moldresistantstrains.com][via email]] to get in touch. I can't promise I'll respond to all emails, but if you have a legitimate thing to talk about, I'm the dude.

My website runs on [[https://wordpress.org/][WordPress]]. I am a supporter of the [[https://www.gnu.org/][GNU project]].
