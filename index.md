# About Jared Cox

My name is Jared Cox. I&rsquo;ve been a web developer for the past 4 years, mostly working on my website [Mold Resistant Strains](https://moldresistantstrains.com/). There you can find a wide range of productive [marijuana seeds for sale](https://moldresistantstrains.com/seed-banks/) online from top breeders. Note that I do not promote nor undertake in illegal activity, I&rsquo;m a [State-licensed](https://health.hawaii.gov/medicalcannabis/) cannabis cultivator.

My seed business is also taxed legally and done by the books. I offer consulting services for business clients in the marijuana seed industry. Contact me [via Twitter](https://twitter.com/moldresistant) or [via email](mailto:jared@moldresistantstrains.com) to get in touch. I can&rsquo;t promise I&rsquo;ll respond to all emails, but if you have a legitimate thing to talk about, I&rsquo;m the dude.

My website runs on [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/). I am a supporter of the [GNU project](https://www.gnu.org/).
